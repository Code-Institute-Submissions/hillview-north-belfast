# Hillview: North Belfast


## Overview
This project was produced in conjunction with the human rights organisation
Participation and the Practice of Rights (PPR). The website aims to capitalise
on recent media exposure (March 2018) to one of their housing campaigns
by providing further information which was not covered in a BBC Spotlight
30 minute documentary, recruiting supporters and establishing new information sources.
